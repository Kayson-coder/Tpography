        <h1>MIGHTY ELEMENTAL MORPHIN MASTERS</h1>
        <h1 class="display-1">ü™ê THE BEGINNING: THE ELEMENTAL PLANET</h1>
        <p>
        
        Long before Earth‚Äôs ancient civilizations rose, there existed a distant world known as the Elemental Planet ‚Äî a realm
        where raw forces of the universe took form. Here, the primordial beings known as the Elemental Ancients crafted the
        Elemental Stones and their matching weapons to harness and maintain balance between creation and destruction.
        
        The Stones weren‚Äôt just weapons ‚Äî they were living conduits of energy, able to bond with chosen warriors, unlocking
        their potential as protectors or conquerors.</p>
        <h1 class="display-2">THE FALL OF ELEMENTAL PLANET</h1>
        <p>But power invites ambition. Greedy warlords, corrupted mages, and rebellious champions began fighting to seize all the
        Stones and weapons for themselves. The planet teetered on the edge of destruction.
        
        To save their creation, the Elemental Ancients made a fateful decision:
        üåå They scattered the Stones across the galaxy ‚Äî their most powerful relics sent to Earth, hidden in temples designed to
        withstand time, war, and human curiosity.
        
        Each temple was guarded by a fierce golem created from the element itself:
        
        Fire golems of molten rock,
        
        Ice beasts of frozen mist,
        
        Crystal titans with diamond-hard skin,
        
        Gravity beasts that could crush with invisible force.</p>
        <h1 class="display-3">Arrival on Earth</h1>
    üåç ARRIVAL ON EARTH
    When the Stones arrived on Earth, they reshaped the world subtly ‚Äî calling to the natural forces around them. Forests
    grew taller near the Plant Temple. Electrical storms raged endlessly above the Electricity Temple. Volcanoes bubbled
    fiercely near the Lava Temple.
    
    For centuries, they lay dormant, their energy waiting to awaken.
<h1 class="display-4">GOLDEN AGE OF DISCOVERY</h1>
    <small>‚öì THE AGE OF DISCOVERY</small>
    During Earth‚Äôs Golden Age of Navigation (15th‚Äì17th centuries), explorers, treasure hunters, and scholars began to
    stumble upon the temples.
    
    Some called them cursed lands.
    Others believed they were gifts from the gods.
    Few survived to tell the tales.
    
    As knowledge spread, legends of the Elemental Stones became woven into human myth:
    
    Merlin‚Äôs staff, said to control magic and chaos magic,
    
    The crystal caves rumored to heal and curse,
    
    The cursed graveyards of the Bone Temple.
