        <h1><mark>THE HISTORY OF ELEMENTAL PLANET </mark></h1>
       <p>Long before Earth knew the touch of life, the Elemental Planet was born in the heart of the cosmos, a world forged from
    the raw, untamed forces of creation itself. It was a realm where firestorms swept across crimson skies, glaciers sang as
    they moved like living giants, and floating mountains hovered effortlessly over oceans of liquid crystal. At its core
    pulsed the Elemental Core — a swirling nexus of pure power where fire, water, earth, air, light, and shadow existed in
    delicate, eternal balance. From this Core emerged the Elemental Ancients, towering beings of immense wisdom and
    strength, each shaped by an element they vowed to protect. To preserve their world’s harmony, they crafted the Elemental
    Stones — flawless gems infused with the primal forces of the universe — and paired each with a sacred weapon, placing
    them within colossal temples guarded by sentient golems. Over eons, civilizations rose around these temples: the
    Firewalkers built cities in blazing canyons, the Earthenborn carved homes in living mountains, the Windrunners soared
    among sky islands, and the Waterspeakers thrived in bioluminescent ocean domes. But as always, peace was fragile. Among
    the Ancients, Maltheron, once the guardian of gravity, was seduced by the hunger for dominion. Corrupting his power, he
    forged the Devil Stone, twisting gravity into a dark force that warped reality itself. His rebellion plunged the planet
    into a catastrophic war, shattering continents, boiling seas, and dimming the stars above. Desperate to save what
    remained, the Ancients sacrificed themselves, sealing Maltheron in a prison of collapsed dimensions and scattering the
    Elemental Stones across the universe to keep them from falling into mortal hands. Some fragments reached Earth,
    embedding themselves deep within its crust, hidden in temples and caves, waiting across millennia for the day they would
    awaken again. And now, as the balance trembles and ancient prophecies stir, a new generation is called — the Mighty
    Elemental Morphin Masters, destined to wield the power of a forgotten age.</p>
